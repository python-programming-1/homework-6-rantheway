## Video Analysis!

Let's analyse some youtube videos! 

Unzip the USvideos.csv.zip and ensure the USvideos.csv is in the same directory 
as videos.py and run the videos.py program. 

You should get an output of all the data.
For the assignment, fill in the functions get_most_popular_and_least_popular_channel
and get_most_liked_and_disliked_channel so that they return the preset dictionaries with the correct
data. 

You'll find the most popular and least popular channel by summing up views for each channel, and
similarly, find the most liked and disliked channel by summing their likes and dislikes.

To clarify, the most disliked channel has the most dislikes, regardless of how many likes it has, and vice versa. 
There are duplicates in the data, but for now you can ignore them and consider each entry unique.
